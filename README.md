## Features

- User-friendly interface for uploading images.
- DeepFake detection using machine learning algorithms.
- Cloud storage integration for image uploads.
- Real-time feedback on DeepFake detection results.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, styled-components
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Cloud Storage**: Cloudinary
- **Machine Learning**: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
  
   git clone https://github.com/username/deepfake-detection.git

   Navigate to the project directory:



cd deepfake-detection
Install dependencies for the backend:



npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory.
Add environment variables for MongoDB connection URI, Cloudinary credentials, and other sensitive information.
Start the backend server:


npm start
Navigate to the client directory:


cd client
Install dependencies for the frontend:


npm install
Start the React development server:


npm start
Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Upload an image using the provided interface.
The backend server will process the image using machine learning algorithms for DeepFake detection.
View the results of the DeepFake detection on the frontend.
Deployment
This project can be deployed to platforms like Heroku for the backend and Vercel/Netlify for the frontend. Make sure to set up environment variables in your deployment environment.
